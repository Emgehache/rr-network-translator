## How to use ?

The code files are all placed in the `libraries/` folder. Put the folder where you want.

The `init.py` file automatically loads all functions and the necessary python libraries when ran. Place it where it is convenient (e.g. at the root of the jupyter server), and modify it to properly set the path to the `libraries/` folder.

A detailed tutorial can be found in `network-rr_tuto.ipynb`.

Have fun!
